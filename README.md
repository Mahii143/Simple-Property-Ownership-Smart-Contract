# Simple-Property-Ownership-Smart-Contract
## The Dapp consists of the following functionalities:

- **Adding property details to the blockchain:** Users can add property details such as property ID, owner address, property description, and property rate to the smart contract through the Dapp.
- **Querying property details:** Users can query the property details from the smart contract through the *Dapp*. This includes fetching the property details by ID, owner address, or property rate.
- **Changing property ownership:** Users can transfer the ownership of a property by sending the required buying amount through the *Dapp* to the previous owner. The transaction is validated by the smart contract and the property ownership is updated accordingly.
- **Overall**, this *Dapp* provides a decentralized and secure way of managing property ownership through the use of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
